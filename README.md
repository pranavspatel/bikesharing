## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create a proposal that supports investors to support a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. From the given dataset, we were able to create visualizations to see average biking durations trends and the relationships between gender and popular biking times. Specifically, this set of visualizations:

1.Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
2.Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
3.Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results
The results of the analysis and visualizations are shown below:
